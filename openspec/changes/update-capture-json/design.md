## Context

StepCI already supports captures from HTTP and gRPC steps, and later steps can reference captures via templates. Today, workflows cannot declare a native transformation that updates selected fields in a captured JSON object while preserving the original structure. Users who need this pattern must emulate it through fragile templating workarounds or additional requests.

This change adds a first-class capture update capability in the workflow contract so the runner can apply deterministic JSON mutations and expose the result as a normal capture for subsequent steps.

Constraints:
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing capture syntax.
- Keep behavior deterministic across protocols and step types.
- Preserve clear validation errors for invalid update definitions.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Add schema-supported syntax to derive an updated JSON capture from an existing capture.
- Support both existing-key overrides and addition of new keys.
- Support nested updates through explicit path notation.
- Evaluate update values through existing templating semantics.
- Guarantee updated capture availability in subsequent steps of the same test run.

**Non-Goals:**
- Full JSON Patch or JSONPath mutation language support.
- Array-level patch semantics beyond direct replacement of a path target.
- Cross-test shared mutable capture state.
- Introducing new template object types.

## Decisions

1. Introduce explicit capture update block in workflow syntax.
- Decision: Add a dedicated update section under capture definitions rather than overloading existing capture selectors.
- Rationale: Keeps extraction and mutation responsibilities separate and easier to validate.
- Alternative considered: Implicit mutation when duplicate capture keys are declared; rejected due to ambiguity and hidden behavior.

2. Apply strict path conflict semantics.
- Decision: Update operations MUST fail when duplicate path entries are declared in the same update block.
- Rationale: Prevents ambiguous intent and avoids accidental overwrites that can hide workflow mistakes.
- Alternative considered: Last-write-wins ordering; rejected because silent conflict resolution can mask authoring errors.

3. Evaluate update values after source capture extraction and before capture storage.
- Decision: Runner computes base captured JSON, then resolves template expressions in update values, then applies updates, then stores final capture.
- Rationale: Ensures updates can reference env, captures, secrets, and testdata with predictable timing.
- Alternative considered: Evaluate templates at workflow parse time; rejected because runtime data is unavailable.

4. Restrict initial path syntax and update scope.
- Decision: Initial path syntax supports dot notation only (for example, `user.profile.name`). Array index updates are not supported in v1.
- Rationale: Constrains complexity for first release and avoids partial array semantics.
- Alternative considered: Bracket notation and array index support in v1; rejected to keep validation and behavior simpler.

5. Treat invalid target paths or non-object roots as hard step errors.
- Decision: If update operation cannot be applied due to incompatible target type, unsupported path syntax (including array index patterns), or invalid path, fail the step with actionable error text.
- Rationale: Prevents silent data corruption and improves troubleshooting.
- Alternative considered: Ignore invalid operations; rejected as unsafe.

6. Preserve source capture unless workflow explicitly chooses the same capture key.
- Decision: Updated object can be written to either a new capture key or the same key based on workflow declaration.
- Rationale: Enables both immutable and in-place styles while remaining explicit.
- Alternative considered: Always require a new key; rejected as unnecessarily restrictive.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Risk] Path notation may be interpreted inconsistently across contributors.
  - Mitigation: Document canonical path format and validation rules in workflow syntax docs and examples.

- [Risk] Mutating large payloads could add runtime overhead.
  - Mitigation: Apply shallow-to-deep path updates without full re-serialization loops where possible; add focused benchmarks.

- [Risk] Overwriting existing capture keys may surprise users.
  - Mitigation: Emit clear docs and examples showing both overwrite and new-key patterns.

- [Trade-off] Strict duplicate-path rejection is less permissive than last-write-wins.
  - Mitigation: Return clear validation errors and examples for splitting or consolidating updates.

## Migration Plan

1. Extend schema definitions with the new capture update fields and dot-notation path validation constraints.
2. Implement runner mutation logic behind the new fields while leaving old syntax untouched.
3. Add tests for key overwrite, key creation, nested path updates, duplicate-path rejection, unsupported array index paths, template-resolved values, and invalid-path errors.
4. Add docs and example workflow demonstrating fetch, mutate, reuse flow.
5. Release as backward-compatible enhancement.

Rollback strategy:
- If defects are found, disable usage by removing update blocks from workflows; existing capture behavior remains unchanged.
- Revert runner support for update fields in a patch release if required.

## Open Questions

- None. The initial scope is fixed to dot-notation-only paths, no array index updates, and duplicate path rejection.
